# 🧠 iCog_Labs Projects

Welcome to my `icog_works` repository — a collection of AI and cognitive architecture projects developed during my internship and research at [iCog Labs](https://icog-labs.com/). This work focuses on next-generation artificial general intelligence (AGI).

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains experiments and implementations that explore symbolic reasoning, knowledge representation, and affective cognitive control systems. Core focuses include:

- 🧬 **MeTTa (Meta Type Talk)**: A multi-paradigm language designed for reasoning over knowledge graphs and programmatic cognitive structures within the Hyperon framework.
- 🧠 **OpenPsi**: A cognitive-affective control system inspired by Psi theory, enabling goal prioritization and emotion-driven decision-making.
- 🔗 **Hyperon**: A high-performance successor to OpenCog Classic, used for experimenting with AGI building blocks.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **MeTTa (Hyperon)** – symbolic AI and logic programming
- **OpenPsi** – emotional and motivational decision-making architecture
- **Python** – supporting utilities and experiment orchestration
- **Graph knowledge representation** – structured data for reasoning

---

## 📌 Example Projects

### 🔹 Genetic Programming for Boolean Logic
- Uses MeTTa to evolve trees representing Boolean expressions.
- Implements **selection**, **crossover**, and **mutation**.
- Evaluates individuals based on a custom fitness function derived from truth tables.

### 🔹 Emotion-Based Task Scheduling (OpenPsi)
- Models behavior driven by internal needs and external stimuli.
- Includes:
  - Emotion intensity calculation
  - Goal conflict resolution
  - Motivation modeling
